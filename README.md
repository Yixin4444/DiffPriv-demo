# A Quick Demo & Tutorial on Anonymization (using üêç)

In this quick Tutorial, we will illustrate some well-known anonymization techniques using some simple examples. We do so from a developer perspective and at the same time want to allow for a better understanding through interactive tinkering. For this purpose, we employ the python programming language and some broadly used packages. These are ensured to be installed above. In particular, this includes:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a function-rich framework for handling and managing data, which is the de-facto-standard used by Data scientists (which will be accessed below under the pd-shortcut)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), a package for fast and advanced computations in Python (used via the NP shortcut)
* [PyDP](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP), a python wrapper around [Google's Differential Privacy Suite](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) (simply used as dp).
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), two packages commonly used together for easily drawing nice and mathematically function-rich diagrams
